Lately I've done my own Laptop Stand.

There's is an interesting financial save that you can make when you do DIY(Do It Yourself):

Financially it makes sense to build something for yourself if the cost it takes to buy it is more
than your current hourly rate at your current job.

If you make eg. 10€/hour, then spending.

What makes the most sense is making furniture that is more expensive than your hourly rate.

Let's say an object costs 100€ on Amazon and doing it yourself would cost 1 hour.
That makes it to be 100€ hourly rate.

If you make 200€ it would make sense to buy it directly and not spend time on building it.

If on the other hand it's a wooden table that's rated at 1000€ piece and would take 10 hours to make.
(1000/10= 100 hourly rate).

Then it would mean that you have to take 5 hours from your own work to assume buying such piece of furnire.

What's I'm trying to get at is that if your hobby implies renovation of making furniture, you're also
creating value for your life and you can do it at minimal cost.

For example I've made a wooden laptop stand that would have cost me 100€. (Very artsy Laptop Stand).

That suppose for me 5 hours at my own work.

I've made one in less than an hour with wood material I've found at my house.
