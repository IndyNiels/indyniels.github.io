It's a very sound financial decision to make things yourself and repair them in this rising inflation era.

I've made my own Wooden Laptop Stand that would have cost me 80€ in Etsy (Very artsy one).

To be able to afford this I would have had to work for 80€/20€ hourly rate = 4 hours

Meanwhile, on my leasure time, I made this in 1 hour.Which means I didn't trade 4 hours of my time for this object.

While I increased my value at (If I sell it in a second hand online shop) 40€.

That day I worked for 4 hours + 1 hours making that Laptop Stand.

If I would have bought it I would be 80€ less rich, while now I get to have that DIY Laptop Stand
and kept the 80€ I made that day.
