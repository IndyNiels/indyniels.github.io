It's a very sound financial decision to make things yourself and repair them in this inflation era.

I've made my own Wooden Laptop Stand that would have cost me 80€ in Etsy (Very artsy one).

To be able to afford this I would have had to work for {%hightlight}80€/20€ hourly rate = 4 hours {%endhighlight}
